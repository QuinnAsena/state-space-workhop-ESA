## State-space modelling

- One of the primary goals of this model is to be able to test multiple hypotheses about the data and lend statistical support to the different hypotheses. 

- This state-space approach allows us to estimate coefficients for taxa interactions and driver-taxa relationships, that we don't get from methods such as ordination or cluster analysis.
- We recommend this method as complimentary to other methods, as both have their advantages.

- Work with uneven time-intervals between observations, and multinomially distributed data

## Today's objectives

1. Learn the data structure for `multinomialTS`
2. Understand how to fit `multinomialTS`
   - Finding starting values with `mnGLMM()`
   - Fitting `mnTS()`
3. Fit `mnTS()` to multiple hypotheses
4. Assess resulting models

## Multinomial and relative abundance data $Y$
::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}

- Multinomial distribution models the probability of counts for each side of a $k$-sided dice rolled $n$ times
- Individuals counted from each of $k$ species when $n$ counts total are made
- Relative abundace data mean we can generate estimates for $n-1$ taxa
- Everything is estimated against a reference group

## The data

The response variable, $Y$, is of count-type data. Covariates, $X$, can be of mixed types (e.g., binary events, or charcoal accumulation rate).

For the model we need two matrices of data:

- $Y =$ Count data (e.g., pollen, diatoms...)
- $X =$ Matrix of covariates

:::

## Estimated effects

Today, we will look into the estimated parameters $B$ and $C$:

- $B =$ Covariate effect
- $C =$ Species interactions

_Fitting the model to estimate different combinations of parameters allows us to test hypotheses and lend statistical support to them._

_For example are species interactions or environmental covariates the primary driver or change?_

# Decisions about the data

1. Key taxa and groups
2. Prediction resolution
3. Parameters to estimate


## Key taxa and groups

- Generating estimates for all matrices for large numbers of taxa is problematic
- so we focus on key groups or taxa, and sum the remaining taxa into the reference group.
- We are going to use Story Lake as an example in this workshop.

## Prediction resolution

- The model will make predictions at a chosen resolution: _e.g.,_ every 50, or 100 years.
- We need to choose a resolution those predictions
  - for palaeo-data we don't attempt to make annual predictions from say 100 observations over 13,000 years, but in 50-100 year bins.

## Parameters to estimate

- We also make decisions aroun which parameters to estimate
  - _e.g.,_ which interactions among taxa

_Fitting the model to different combinations of parameters and assessing the resulting models lends statistical support to hypotheses about the data._

## Key points

- Response variable $Y$ is multinomially distributed
- Covariate $X$ may be of mixed types
- Key taxa and groups are chosen
- A prediction resolution is chosen
- Fit the model to different combinations of parameters to test alternative hypotheses
